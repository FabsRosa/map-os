  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This application leverages the Google Maps API to provide a real-time, dynamic map-based solution for managing the 
    locations of service orders and the motorcycles assigned to them. It is designed to streamline operations and improve 
    the efficiency of field service management through several key features:

  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Interactive Sidebar:</strong> A sliding sidebar offers a range of filters to customize the display of information, allowing users to focus on specific orders or technicians.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> The map data is refreshed at regular intervals, ensuring that users have the most up-to-date information about service orders and vehicle locations.</li>
    <li><strong>Order Pin Visualization:</strong> Service order pins are color-coded and marked with the initials of the assigned technician, providing clear, intuitive visual cues.</li>
    <li><strong>Motorcycle Status Monitoring:</strong> Motorcycle icons change color dynamically based on their movement. If a motorcycle remains idle for too long in an inappropriate location, the color changes to alert the user.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple Map Views:</strong> The application supports two distinct map typesâ€”one displaying service orders and another dedicated to monitoring alarms, offering tailored insights depending on the user's needs.</li>
  </ul>
